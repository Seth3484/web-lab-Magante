# web-lab-Magante

**Name:** Seth D. Magante

**Project Description:**  
This project showcases a simple yet functional web application developed as part of a midterm lab exam. It integrates version control practices, user-centered design principles, and modern web development frameworks.

The goal of this lab is to demonstrate proficiency in collaborative coding, interface prototyping, and deploying interactive features using a structured development workflow.

**Purpose:**  
This lab exam is a chance for me to bring together everything I’ve learned so far from using Git to manage my work, to designing interfaces that make sense, and building something real with a modern web framework. It’s not just about checking boxes; it’s about showing that I can take an idea, plan it out, and turn it into a working app while keeping things clean, organized, and user friendly." > README.md
